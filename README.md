# licru
Linux server-side scripts i use everyday  
  
#Install/Deinstall  
To install simply execute ./licru.sh install\n  
To deinstall execute ./licru.sh deinstall   
And reinstall ./licru reinstall - Usefull to update all scripts after git pull.  
  
By the default it installs scripts to /usr/bin directory.   
Sometime i would add custom install directory, if needed.
